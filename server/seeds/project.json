Trim the vase to clean up any irregularities and refine the shape. Be careful not to trim too much. 5. Bisque Fire: - Fire the vase in the kiln to bisque temperature (typically around 1800°F or 1,000°C). This first firing hardens the clay and prepares it for glazing. 6. Glaze the Vase: - Apply glaze to the bisque-fired vase. You can use brushes, dipping, or spraying techniques to apply the glaze. Experiment with different glaze combinations and techniques for unique effects. 7. Glaze Fire: - Fire the glazed vase in the kiln to glaze temperature (usually around 2,200°F or 1,200°C). This second firing melts the glaze and creates the final finish. 8. Finish and Inspect: - After firing, inspect the vase for any imperfections or adjustments needed. Clean any kiln residue and make any final touches. This project challenges your skills in wheel throwing, trimming, glazing, and firing, resulting in a sophisticated and finely crafted ceramic vase.",
