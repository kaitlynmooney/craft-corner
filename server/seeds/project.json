Cost: $2 - $5 Tapestry Needle: For weaving in ends. Cost: $1 - $3 Estimated Total Cost: $10 - $23 Project Steps: Chain Stitch (Ch): Start by making a chain the width of your scarf, typically 20-30 stitches. Single Crochet (Sc): Work single crochet stitches across the chain. Repeat: Turn your work and continue single crocheting back and forth until the scarf reaches your desired length (usually around 60-70 inches). Finish Off: Cut the yarn, leaving a tail, and use the tapestry needle to weave in the ends. This project is perfect for getting comfortable with basic stitches and handling yarn, and by the end, youâ€™ll have a cozy scarf to show off!",
