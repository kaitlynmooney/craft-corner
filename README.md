## Usage

The website can be visited at http://craft-corner.onrender.com/. Please allow about a minute for the site to load, as periods of site inactivity cause slow connections to the website.

From the Home page, users can go to the "Login/Signup" page or can add take our "Crafting Survey".

The "Crafting Survey" allows users to select their crafting preferences, including their level of comfort with crafting, price range, and preffered craft types.

On the Login page, users can sign up or sign in using an existing account. Once a user has successfully logged in, they will see an option to "Logout" on the navigation bar.

Before a logged in user has taken the survey, their navigation bar will allow them to "Logout" and go to "Survey". Once the user has taken the survey, they will also see options for the "Explore" and "Dashboard" pages.

On the Dashboard page, users can view their Profile, including the number of crafts they've completed, their "Crafter Status", and an avatar which they can change. They can also see the projects they're working on, their saved projects, and their recommended projects. Users can also use the buttons below their profile to navigate to create new projects and to see and delete any of the projects they've authored.

On the explore page, users can search for new projects in the featured, popular, new, and affordable categories or search for new project from the specific craft type they are interested in.
